## Download the App
* ...

## Pre-requisites

* NodeJS LTS (Download)[https://nodejs.org/en/]
* If you have a globally installed version of Cordova, uninstall.
* Content from `protected.zip`:
  * src/psiphon_config.json
  * static/ADBMobileConfig.json
* For iOS build/development, install XCode (only available on MacOS)
* For Android build/development, install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) ([additional setup required](#android-setup))

## Quickstart

To set up:
* `npm install`
* `npx cordova prepare`
  - If you encounter plugin installation errors, re-run `npx cordova prepare` until you get no errors
* If you have the password to `protected.zip`, you can run `npm run protected:unzip` and supply the password when prompted

To build & run:
* `npm run start:web` - to run in the browser
* `npm run start:android` - to run in an Android emulator or device
* `npm run start:ios` - to run in an iOS emulator or device

For CI:
* `npm run build`

To Publish to TestFlight:
* In XCode, select the project, switch to Build Phases tab, add new script
```
set -e
bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/PsiphonTunnel.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"
```
* In XCode, run `Product -> Archive`
  - Validate the archive
    - Strip and upload symbols _(both boxes checked on first screen)_
    - Have XCode manage signing _(top radio button checked on second screen)_
  - **If and only if validation succeeds** hit "Upload to App Store..." button
    - Strip and upload symbols _(both boxes checked on first screen)_
    - Have XCode manage signing _(top radio button checked on second screen)_
* Go to [iTunes Connect -> My Apps](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app)
  - Select appropriate app
  - Select the "TestFlight" tab
    - If you don't see your build, it may still be processing
    - You can check on its status in the "Activity" tab
    - If it's processing, wait until it completes (will take 5 - 10 minutes)
  - From the "TestFlight" tab
    - Open your build version
    - If it has a green circle and says "Testing", you're good to go
    - It may require export compliance information:
      1. Does your app use encryption? Select Yes even if your app only uses the standard encryption in iOS and macOS.
        - Yes
      2. Does your app qualify for any of the exemptions provided in Category 5, Part 2 of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations?
        - Yes

## Android setup
In order to be able to build and run Android, you'll need to do have the following:
* From SDK Platforms:
  1. At least Android 7.1.1 (api level 25)
* From SDK Tools:
  1. Android SDK Build-Tools
  1. Android Emulator
  1. Android SDK Platform-Tools
  1. Android SDK Tools
  1. Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)
* Either a working ADV or a physical device that can be connected to the computer
  - When you run `npm run start:android`, you should either see the text `AVD Discovered` or a CLI menu
    - If you see the CLI menu but you see no ADVs (nothing is selectable besides `Quit`), you either need to ensure your physical device is connected properly or create a working ADV
    - If instead, you see text warning of an unhandled promise rejection, cancel the command and try again

## Using this as a base

### Files to update

* `package.json`
  - change the name to be unique for your project
  - change the app id in the `deploy:android` script to be the same as the app id in your `config.xml`
* `config.xml`
  - change the app id to be unique for your project
  - reset the version code and version number to `100000` and `1.0.0` respectively
  - change the name of the app (both short and long) for your project
  - change all of the author fields to the correct information for your project
* `circle.yml`
  - update the cache keys to be unique for your project
    (ex. `v1-your-project-npm-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}`)
* `scripts/buildAndroid.sh`
  - update the `--alias` cli argument to be the same as chosen for your [keystore](#generating-a-keystore)
* `src/labels.tsx`
  - this is where all of the static labels for the app live
  - language-specific configuration (date locale, text direction, etc.) lives here, too

### Generating a keystore

Run the following command and follow the prompts:
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore build.keystore -alias [app-name] -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
